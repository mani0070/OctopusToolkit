resolve variables based on 1 scope
find variable usages across all proj, sets and in other variables

for scope searching:
  variables scope - done
  envrionments scope
     - node -> machines
     - machines -> environmets
     - nodes -> environments
     
when searching for environment scope and machines that have been scoped to it
